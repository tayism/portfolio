      	<p class="about-me-header">Taylor Reyes Sihapanya</p>
      	<p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by. My name is Taylor, and I’m currently a designer of student experience and support at Thinkful (a Chegg service), looking to make my way over to UX full-time. A natural at creative problem solving. I have long enjoyed being presented with a problem and being asked: “how would you solve this?”</p>
      	<p>In my most recent roles in the last 5 years, I’ve provided counseling and guidance to data science, data analytics, web development, and design students. Prior to working in EdTech, I worked in Health Education for Kaiser Permanente for 5 years. It is through these experiences that I have gained my empathetic insights to users. Their motivations and what is most important to them, is what is most important to me. While at SFSU I studied communication through verbal and non-verbal cues, but design and code have always been intertwined in my life and interests since the age of geocities pages and aol chat rooms.</p>
      	<p>When I’m not working, you’ll find me spending time with my husband and two young daughters. We love a good mix of the outdoors, video games, and of course, good food (and matcha for this mama). I also love picking up new creative outlets. Currently, I am learning how to play the ukulele.</p>
      	<p>I am open to new opportunities, if the fit is right. Please feel free to reach out anytime.</p>
