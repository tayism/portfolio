         <h2>The Summary</h2>
         <p>The cloud storage market is crowded, and the need to be mindful and inventive in this new storage solution is apparent. Being able to fold in additional problems to solve for this is what we aimed for, to create a unique perspective. Travel is the market that made the most sense in creating a cloud storage solution in this MVP because there are longevity and growth in catering to a market of travelers worldwide.</p>
         <br>
         <!-- the problem -->
         <h2>The Problem</h2>
         <p>The key points to keep in mind for this app were the ability to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>save</li>
            <li>organize</li>
            <li>create</li>
            <li>upload</li>
            <li>share</li>
            <li>and connect</li>
         </ul>
         <p>I would need to break down the cloud storage and travel markets simultaneously to find an appropriate fit for this app.</p>
         <br>
         <!-- the solution -->
         <section class="thesolution">
         <h2>The Solution</h2>
         <p>This is where Wanderlist enters. Because the playing field of cloud storage and travel is saturated, a unique combination of these features to bring a competitor in Wanderlist to life is apparent.</p>
         <p>Through robust research and analysis of potential users, I found several solutions that prove useful within the scope of our MVP.</p>
         <p>The first and foremost is bringing an app to life within Wanderlist to quickly <span class="bold">organize</span> and <span class="bold">store travel information</span> that is also <span class="bold">collaborative with other users.</span></p>
         <p>Stemming from that, there was a need to thoughtfully display all aspects of travel plans and remove the need to search through endless emails to keep up to date with bookings.</p>
         <p><span class="bold">Displaying information for plane/car bookings, accommodations, activities, restaurants, messaging with travel mates, and photo storage are all important aspects of this app.</span></p>

         <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
         <p>As the premiere researcher, information architect, and designer, it was my job to pull loads of data from different sources and display them in thoughtful ways that cater to the user’s wishes while also satisfying our MVP.</p>
         <h3>Where do we fit in?</h3>
         <p>From a Competitive Analysis between Pinterest, OneNote, and Pearltrees, which have a combination of cloud storage options that the stakeholder desired, I found a few key points that would help this app find a place in the market.</p>

         <p>The pricing structure is important, and clarity is needed here. A free option should offer enough space for robust features but higher subscription levels can also allow users to customize the product for themselves even more.</p>
         <img class="pricingplans" src="images/pricingplans.png" alt="wanderlist pricing">
         <p>The design should provide inspiration through imagery while also allowing space for users to add their own input of notes, structure, and customization. Different tools would allow users to be more interactive with the product and build it to fit their own needs.</p>

         <!-- validate through users -->
         <h2>Validate through users.</h2>
         <div class="research-and-discovery">
         <p>Through a User Survey that pulled a large amount of data from potential users with interests in cloud storage services and travel, I was able to find unique insights into what users find helpful and what can be left behind. Insights into most-liked and non-negotiable features.</p>
         <p>A common theme discovered here was the preference for <span class="bold">mobile devices over the web</span> and this helped us go in the direction of mobile-first for the overall design.</p>
         <p>Some of the most robust data came from the next survey question, when users indicated they would use cloud services for their travel organizational needs by:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>compiling flight and hotel data</li>
            <li>sharing plans with others</li>
            <li>& finding inspiration for things to do/see/places to eat</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Many of these areas are confirmations of the project directives from the initial brief. Through additional 1:1 user interviews, I was able to gain direct insight into what users were comfortable with and what lacked in the current services they had been using.</p>

         <h2>Branding</h2>
         <p>Branding work began at this point, and some initial ideas were put in place to create a feel of Wanderlist. Much brainstorming, sketching, use of mood boards, and branding summaries were used here. This is also where I found the overall feel of Wanderlist that would structure past research with future design choices: “Quickly organize all of your travel plans with Wanderlist”. This work was refined through logo work, typeface choices, and additional aspects to mood boards as the overall brand of Wanderlist was built.</p>

Where do we fit in?), and the business goals, which were ultimately, creating a unique product that solves multiple problems for users.</p>
         <p>The style guide went through several iterations after testing rounds, because the color palette needed refining.</p>

         <p>With the style guide in place, I went forth with building Hi-fidelity Mockups that we could prove through another round of user testing and accomplish the creation of an MVP. Because much of the branding and color palette had light and airy choices, many rounds of color contrast testing were used in this process as accessibility in design is of high importance. Building a product that caters to all users of different abilities is key. This process also helped to build key components that could be easily reused throughout the design and any future iterations. This helped to structure future deliverables as well.</p>

         <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
         <p>With a quick round of Preference Testing, I was able to suss out any unclear options directly with users. The insights gained from users here would help direct the final version of Wanderlist to prove in the second round of prototyping and testing.</p>

         Users wanted separated dropdowns so they can see more granular detail within each trip. Visually, more organized.</p>

         Users wanted to be able to scroll through an entire list of current and future trips so that there were not extra pages to click forward and back through.</p>

         <br>
         Users were able to identify off the cuff that clicking on the image would bring them to profiles or settings. This was behavior that was ingrained, and no other direction was needed.</p>

         <h3>High Fidelity Protyping & Usability Testing (round 2)</h3>
         <p>The second, Hi-fidelity version of Prototyping and Usability Testing was put together here. This is where I got to break down key aspects of the design and questions that remain unclear in how the design is presented.</p>
         <img class="computer-hands" src="images/computerhands.jpg" alt="user testing">
         <p><span class="bold">I presented users with questions like:</span></p>
         <ul>
            <li>How do you add a new trip with all itinerary details?</li>
            <li>How do you add a collaborator to a trip?</li>
            <li>How do you add a comment to a trip?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>I learned from this round of testing that more ease could be inserted here to create a more intuitive experience in the app. I also learned that these were key aspects of Wanderlist that users needed the most.</p>

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
         <p>After wrapping up Wanderlist and reflecting on how the overall project went, I would say it went really well. I am proud to say that we built a product that is unique to the market and can have longevity there.</p>
         <p><span class="bold">Something that worked especially well that lead to this positive reflection was:</span>
         <ul>
            <li>The several rounds of user testing and usability testing that occurred.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Each time, users were excited to use the product and had a lot of wonderful feedback for how they would essentially use Wanderlist. This excitement and eagerness to work with our team was definitely felt.
         <p><span class="bold">Something that did not work especially well at first:</span></p>
         <ul>
            <li>The comment and chat feature in the app.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>There were many struggles trying to figure out the best route for users and what made sense with the overall theme of Wanderlist. There were definitely doubts going into the project with this key aspect in mind, and I particularly knew that this feature had to be less of an afterthought. After the many rounds of testing that I did, and iterations of the design structure and flow, I feel that a solution was found that was not only intuitive but helpful to users as well.</p>
         <p><span class="bold">If I had more time</span> to build out Wanderlist past this MVP version, I would definitely focus my attention on the functionality of building <span class="bold">more customized trips.</span></p>
         <p>Making this section a bit more robust in the way that it displays information to the user upon sign in would communicate more of the easiness that users have been asking for since the beginning of the project.</p>
         <p>I would also focus a lot of attention on <span class="bold">integrating location services and reviews</span> (ie: Yelp) so that users could have helpful tools within the app that synced with other, most-used travel tools.</p>
         <p>This project reconfirmed for me the power of the user, and how important it is to include them on every step. The insights you gain are extremely valuable, and <span class="bold">many ideas stem from the conversations you have with actual users</span> of the product. Their excitement is a driving force that can lead the team forward in times of confusion or uncertainty.</p>
