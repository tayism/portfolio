            <p>A cloud-integrated travel app that keeps travelers organized while on the go.</p>

         <h2>The Summary</h2>
         </p>
         <p>The cloud storage market is crowded, and the need to be mindful and inventive in this new storage solution is apparent. Being able to fold in additional problems to solve for this is what we aimed for, to create a unique perspective. Travel is the market that made the most sense in creating a cloud storage solution in this MVP because there are longevity and growth in catering to a market of travelers worldwide.</p>
         <br>
         <!-- the problem -->
         <p>
         <h2>The Problem</h2>
         </p>
         <p>The key points to keep in mind for this app were the ability to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>save</li>
            <li>organize</li>
            <li>create</li>
            <li>upload</li>
            <li>share</li>
            <li>and connect</li>
         </ul>
         <p>I would need to break down the cloud storage and travel markets simultaneously to find an appropriate fit for this app.</p>
         <br>
         <!-- the solution -->
         <p>
         <h2>The Solution</h2>
         </p>
         <p>This is where Wanderlist enters. Because the playing field of cloud storage and travel is saturated, a unique combination of these features to bring a competitor in Wanderlist to life is apparent.</p>
         <p>Through robust research and analysis of potential users, I found several solutions that prove 	useful within the scope of our MVP.</p>
         <p>The first and foremost is bringing an app to life within Wanderlist to quickly organize and store travel information that is also collaborative with other users.</p>
         <p>Stemming from that, there was a need to thoughtfully display all aspects of travel plans and remove the need to search through endless emails to keep up to date with bookings.</p>
         <p>Displaying information for plane/car bookings, accommodations, activities, restaurants, messaging with travel mates, and photo storage are all important aspects of this app.</p>

         <h1>Research & Discovery</h1>
         <p>As the premiere researcher, information architect, and designer, it was my job to pull loads of data from different sources and display them in thoughtful ways that cater to the user’s wishes while also satisfying our MVP.</p>
         <p>
         <h2>Where do we fit in?</h2>
         </p>
         <p>From a Competitive Analysis between Pinterest, OneNote, and Pearltrees, which have a combination of cloud storage options that the stakeholder desired, I found a few key points that would help this app find a place in the market.</p>
         <img src="http://" alt="pinterest logo">
         <img src="http://" alt="onenote logo">
         <img src="http://" alt="pearltrees logo">
         <p>The pricing structure is important, and clarity is needed here. A free option should offer enough space for robust features but higher subscription levels can also allow users to customize the product for themselves even more.</p>
         <img src="http://" alt="wanderlist pricing">
         <p>The design should provide inspiration through imagery while also allowing space for users to add their own input of notes, structure, and customization. Different tools would allow users to be more interactive with the product and build it to fit their own needs.</p>
         <!-- validate through users -->
         <p>
         <h2>Validate through users.</h2>
         </p>
         <p>Through a User Survey that pulled a large amount of data from potential users with interests in cloud storage services and travel, I was able to find unique insights into what users find helpful and what can be left behind. Insights into most-liked and non-negotiable features.</p>
         <p>A common theme discovered here was the preference for mobile devices over the web and this helped us go in the direction of mobile-first for the overall design.</p>
         <p>Some of the most robust data came from the next survey question, when users indicated they would use cloud services for their travel organizational needs by:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>compiling flight and hotel data</li>
            <li>sharing plans with others</li>
            <li>& finding inspiration for things to do/see/places to eat</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Many of these areas are confirmations of the project directives from the initial brief. Through additional 1:1 user interviews, I was able to gain direct insight into what users were comfortable with and what lacked in the current services they had been using.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I sketched out User Flows that stemmed from the previous user stories and adjusted these as needed to create digital versions for easier collaboration with stakeholders.

            <p>Aside from the sketches, we went through 4 versions of the digital user flows. The rest of the research and design process brought insights of certain key functions that could be better communicated. Constant reiteration is key.</p>

         <h1>Branding</h1>
         </p>
         <p>Branding work began at this point, and some initial ideas were put in place to create a feel of Wanderlist. Much brainstorming, sketching, use of mood boards, and branding summaries were used here. This is also where I found the overall feel of Wanderlist that would structure past research with future design choices: “Quickly organize all of your travel plans with Wanderlist”. This work was refined through logo work, typeface choices, and additional aspects to mood boards as the overall brand of Wanderlist was built.</p>

         <h1>Style Guide</h1>
         </p>
         <p>A Style Guide was then built to encompass all of the unique aspects of Wanderlist. These stylistic choices were made from the analysis of the competition in both the travel and cloud storage markets, search for differentiation in the current market (what is not currently available? Where do we fit in?), and the business goals, which were ultimately, creating a unique product that solves multiple problems for users.</p>
         <p>The style guide went through several iterations after testing rounds, because the color palette needed refining.</p>

         <p>Key Insight: Many users described feelings of excitement and calm when it came to summertime or beach travel -- thus the need to get closer to a color palette that invoked a sunset feel than the more earthy feel that was used originally. This is where the logos were also refined, as the color palette started to change.</p>

         <p>With the style guide in place, I went forth with building Hi-fidelity Mockups that we could prove through another round of user testing and accomplish the creation of an MVP. Because much of the branding and color palette had light and airy choices, many rounds of color contrast testing were used in this process as accessibility in design is of high importance. Building a product that caters to all users of different abilities is key. This process also helped to build key components that could be easily reused throughout the design and any future iterations. This helped to structure future deliverables as well.</p>

         <p>I presented users with questions like:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>How do you add a new trip with all itinerary details?</li>
            <li>How do you add a collaborator to a trip?</li>
            <li>How do you add a comment to a trip?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>I learned from this round of testing that more ease could be inserted here to create a more intuitive experience in the app. I also learned that these were key aspects of Wanderlist that users needed the most.</p>

         <h1>Conclusion</h1>
         </p>
         <p>After wrapping up Wanderlist and reflecting on how the overall project went, I would say it went really well. I am proud to say that we built a product that is unique to the market and can have longevity there.</p>
         <p>Some things that worked especially well that lead to this positive reflection were:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The several rounds of user testing and usability testing that occurred.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Each time, users were excited to use the product and had a lot of wonderful feedback for how they would essentially use Wanderlist. This excitement and eagerness to work with our team was definitely felt.
         <p>
         <p>Something that did not work especially well at first:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The comment and chat feature in the app.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>There were many struggles trying to figure out the best route for users and what made sense with the overall theme of Wanderlist. There were definitely doubts going into the project with this key aspect in mind, and I particularly knew that this feature had to be less of an afterthought. After the many rounds of testing that I did, and iterations of the design structure and flow, I feel that a solution was found that was not only intuitive but helpful to users as well.</p>
         <p>If I had more time to build out Wanderlist past this MVP version, I would definitely focus my attention on the functionality of building more customized trips.</p>
         <p>Making this section a bit more robust in the way that it displays information to the user upon sign in would communicate more of the easiness that users have been asking for since the beginning of the project.</p>
         <p>I would also focus a lot of attention on integrating location services and reviews (ie: Yelp) so that users could have helpful tools within the app that synced with other, most-used travel tools.</p>
         <p>This project reconfirmed for me the power of the user, and how important it is to include them on every step. The insights you gain are extremely valuable, and many ideas stem from the conversations you have with actual users of the product. Their excitement is a driving force that can lead the team forward in times of confusion or uncertainty.</p>
